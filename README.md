Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The app that I selected to design was the weight tracking app, since I have previously used similar apps in the past. The user needs that it was designed to address was to simplify the process of tracking weight by minimizing the time it took out of someone's day to do so.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The app design needed to have three primary screens, one to login, one to display and edit the actual weight tracking function, and one to enable SMS updates for goal-tracking. I kept my UI simple, displaying the necessary functions in a simple manner to meet of the goal of limiting the time cost of using the app.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
My coding process was based around identifying the user needs and organizing them by requirements. From there it was a simple process of completing each requirement one by one and ensuring they functioned together. This is the way the I have completed programming requirements in the past and it has worked well for me.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
Testing is often the most important part of the developments process since it can discern where parts of the code do not function as intended. My testing process is often a simple procedure of running specific parts of the program to ensure they work as intended, and then again so that I know they interact with other pieces as intended.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I had to look into some programming content to identify a good way to create the graph UI element for the weight tracking feature. I found a video displaying a method on how to create a graph in Android Studio and that became the basis for how I constructed that screen.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I was very happy with how the user login screen came out, especially after researching how to make more design changes such as background color, etc. This part was probably the most satisfying part of the project.
